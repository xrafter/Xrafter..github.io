 <p style="text-indent:40px;font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> Apple is a huge company that produces iphones, earbuds and computers. They captivate their audience with their power that comes from the devices they make. With all the competition from bigger companys like Dell, Microsoft, Samsung and other off-brand companys how come they have kept their head in the top of the game? Its because of the Apple Trap. 
   <br><br>
   The Apple Trap is a theory that once a individual buy a apple phone, the next version either makes the buyer jealous of that version. Evidence to prove this will be the most recent Iphone, The Iphone X. Within the first week of its release it sold out in almost <b>every</b> apple store in the US. Carriers like Sprint, MetroPCS, Verizon have certain plans whenever a phone is released it will become "free" to the person subscribed to the plan.
